# Translation App

### NPM Packages Required:
```
create-react-app -> 5.0.1
axios -> 1.2.0
```

## Notes
This project is the initial demo to get a taste of how React works. This was initially done in an online editor but I copied the files to my local set up by doing the following below. Note that this assumes you have npm installed on your local set up.

1. In a folder, initialize a `create-react-app` application using the command `npx create-react-app NAME-OF-YOUR-TRANSLATION-APP`

2. A new folder called `NAME-OF-YOUR-TRANSLATION-APP` will appear. 

   - If this folder exists within a git repo, remove any `.gitignore` file or `.git` folders created in the new folder, if any. This will cause an error when you're trying to push the outer repo to git

3. Go to the URL mentioned in the course and copy the directory structure and files of the project, adding and removing folders / copy-pasting file contents / etc.
